# Automated-Greenhouse
A fun summer Arduino based project for automating watering in a greenhouse.

To simplify things, this system is open loop. This means that no sensors are used for feedback, meaning a fixed amount of water is pumped into the greenhouse every day
An operator is needed to adjust the amount of water pumped by pressing two buttons, either for more, or less water.

An LCD screen is used to display the amount of water pumped each day, for easy adjustment.

A food container with a rubber lip around the lid is used as a waterproof enclosure for the arduino Uno and the other electronics.

For future iterations, sensors measuring temperature, humidity and soil moistrue might be added.
